        "description": "Lepirudin is a recombinant hirudin formed by 65 amino acids that acts as a highly specific and direct thrombin inhibitor.[L41539,L41569] Natural hirudin is an endogenous anticoagulant found in _Hirudo medicinalis_ leeches.[L41539] Lepirudin is produced in yeast cells and is identical to natural hirudin except for the absence of sulfate on the tyrosine residue at position 63 and the substitution of leucine for isoleucine at position 1 (N-terminal end).[A246609] &#13;\n&#13;\nLepirudin is used as an anticoagulant in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), an immune reaction associated with a high risk of thromboembolic complications.[A3, L41539] HIT is caused by the expression of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that bind to the complex formed by heparin and platelet factor 4. This activates endothelial cells and platelets and enhances the formation of thrombi.[A246609] Bayer ceased the production of lepirudin (Refludan) effective May 31, 2012.[L41574]",

        "indication": "Lepirudin is indicated for anticoagulation in adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) such as unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction without ST elevation. In patients with ACS, lepirudin is intended for use with [aspirin].[L41539] Lepirudin is also indicated for anticoagulation in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and associated thromboembolic disease in order to prevent further thromboembolic complications.[L41539]",
        "pharmacodynamics": "Lepirudin is a recombinant hirudin that acts as a highly specific thrombin inhibitor. Its activity is measured by anti-thrombin units (ATUs) that correspond to the amount of lepirudin required to neutralize a unit of the World Health Organization Î±-thrombin (89/588) standard. The activity of lepirudin is 16,000 ATU/mg.[L41539,L41569] A single molecule of lepirudin binds to a molecule of thrombin, blocking its thrombogenic activity. This drug increases activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)  and PT (INR) values in a dose-dependent manner, and its mode of action is independent of antithrombin III.[L41539,L41569] Platelet factor 4 does not inhibit lepirudin.[L41539,L41569]&#13;\n&#13;\nThe pharmacodynamic effect of lepirudin was evaluated by measuring an increase in aPTT. No saturable effect was observed at the highest tested dose (0.5 mg/kg, IV bolus).[L41539] Thrombin time was considered an unsuitable routine test for lepirudin monitoring due to the high values detected (200 seconds) even at low doses.[L41539] The concomitant use of thrombolytic therapy and lepirudin is not recommended due to the high risk of bleeding that may be life-threatening. In patients with a risk of bleeding, a physician should weigh the risks of lepirudin administration against its benefits.  There is also an especially high risk of bleeding in patients who weigh less than 50 kg, and a lower dosage is required. Patients with renal impairment have a higher risk of hemorrhagic adverse events.[L41539]",
        "mechanism-of-action": "Lepirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor used as an anticoagulant in patients for whom heparin is contraindicated.[L41539,A3] Thrombin is a serine protease that participates in the blood-clotting cascade, and it is formed by the cleavage of pro-thrombin. Active thrombin cleaves fibrinogen and generates fibrin monomers that polymerize to form fibrin clots.[A246624]&#13;\n&#13;\nLepirudin binds to the catalytic and substrate-binding sites of thrombin, forming a stable, irreversible and non-covalent complex.[A246609] This blocks the protease activity of thrombin and inhibits the coagulation process. Each molecule of lepirudin binds to a single molecule of thrombin,[L41539] and unlike [heparin], it is able to inhibit thrombin in both its clot-bound or free states.[A246609]",
        "toxicity": "The acute toxicity of intravenous lepirudin was evaluated in mice (0.1-1000 mg/kg), rats (1-1000 mg/kg), and monkeys (1-100 mg/kg), and toxicity was not detected at the doses investigated.[L41539] The acute toxicity of lepirudin administered subcutaneously was also evaluated in mice (1-1250 mg/kg) and rats (1-500 mg/kg), and no toxicity was detected.[L41539] One rat (100 mg/kg) died of rapid blood loss after the subcutaneous administration of lepirudin. Reactions to local injections such as hemorrhages, hematomas and/or nodules were detected in mice and rats given subcutaneous doses of lepirudin equal or higher than 500 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively.[L41539] &#13;\n&#13;\nChronic toxicity was evaluated in rats and monkeys given lepirudin for up to 3 months. Most of the effects observed were due to the antithrombotic action of lepirudin. After 3 months, hemosiderin deposits in the spleen and moderate sinus histiocytosis in the lymph node were observed in rats. In monkeys, external and internal hemorrhages and hematomas were detected.[L41539] Lepidurin was reported as not mutagenic.[L41539]&#13;\n&#13;\nRelative overdose may occur in patients with renal impairment, therefore, bolus dose and rate of infusion must be reduced in case of known or suspected renal insufficiency.[L41539] Excessively high activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) values suggest an overdose and a risk of bleeding. Lepirudin has no known antidote. In case of life-threatening bleeding and if excessive plasma levels of lepirudin are suspected: 1)stop the administration of lepirudin immediately, 2) determine aPTT and coagulation parameters, 3) determine hemoglobin, and prepare for a transfusion, 4) follow the treatment guidelines for patients with shock.[L41539] Hemofiltration or hemodialysis may be useful in case of overdose, based in single case reports and animal data.[L41539]",
        "metabolism": "As a polypeptide, lepirudin is expected to be metabolized by the sequential cleavage of amino acids by kidney exoproteases, which have carboxypeptidase and dipeptidase-like activity.[L41539,L41544] The C-terminal cleavage of lepirudin aminoacids (aminoacids 1 to 65) produces four metabolites with anti-thrombotic activity: M1 (aminoacids 1 to 64), M2 (aminoacids 1 to 63), M3 (aminoacids 1 to 62), and M4 (aminoacids 1 to 61).[L41544]",
        "absorption": "Lepirudin administered as a single intravenous bolus injection of 0.4 mg/kg in 9 healthy volunteers (male and female) resulted in a C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 2924 ng/mL, a t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.17 h and an AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-â&lt;/sub&gt; of 2500 ngâ¢h/mL.[L41539] When 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 mg/kg of lepirudin was administered as a single intravenous infusion over 6 hours in healthy male volunteers, lepirudin had a corresponding C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 111, 203, and 2446 ng/mL and a corresponding AUC of 612, 1184, and 1446 ngâ¢h/mL.[L41544] Bioavailability is 100% following injection. Also, it has been reported that following subcutaneous (sc) administration, the bioavailability of lepirudin is almost 100%.[A246609]",
        "half-life": "Lepirudin has an initial half-life of approximately 10 minutes, and in young healthy volunteers, it has a terminal half-time of 1.3 hours.[L41539] Lepirudin has a first-order elimination kinetic; plasma concentration increases proportionally as the lepirudin intravenous dose is increased. Elimination half-life values of up to 2 days were detected in patients with marked renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt; 15 mL/min).[L41539]",
        "protein-binding": "In human plasma, the protein binding of lepirudin was approximately 3%.[L41539]",
        "route-of-elimination": "Lepirudin is mostly excreted through urine (48.3%). About 35% of lepirudin is excreted unchanged, while metabolites are found in a smaller proportion (2.5% of M1, 5.4% of M2, 3.9% of M3 and 1.6% of M4).[L41544]",
        "volume-of-distribution": "The volume of distribution of lepirudin at steady state was 12.2 L in healthy young subjects (n=18, 18-60 years), 18.7 L in healthy elderly subjects (n=10, 65-80 years), 18.0 L in renally impaired subjects (n=16, creatinine clearance &lt; 80 mL/min, and 32.1 L in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia patients (n=73).[L41539] The distribution of lepirudin is mainly restricted to extracellular fluids.[L41539]",
        "clearance": "The clearance of lepirudin is proportional to the glomerular filtration rate. On average, lepirudin clearance was 164 mL/min in healthy young subjects (n=18, 18-60 years) and 25% lower in women than in men. In healthy elderly subjects (n=10, 65-80 years), clearance was 139 mL/min, about 20% lower than in younger patients.[L41539] This is possibly due to the lower creatinine clearance in elderly patients. In renally impaired subjects (n=16, creatinine clearance &lt; 80 mL/min), clearance was 61 mL/min, and in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia patients (n=73), it was 114 mL/min.[L41539]",

        "indication": "Cetuximab indicated for the treatment of locally or regionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with radiation therapy. It is indicated for treating a recurrent locoregional disease or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with platinum-based therapy with fluorouracil. It is indicated for recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck progressing after platinum-based therapy.[L30448]&#13;\n&#13;\nCetuximab is also indicated for K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing, metastatic colorectal cancer as determined by an FDA-approved test in combination with FOLFIRI, a chemotherapy combination that includes [leucovorin], [fluorouracil], and [irinotecan]; in combination with irinotecan in patients who are refractory to irinotecan-based chemotherapy; or as monotherapy in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy or who are intolerant to irinotecan.[L30448]&#13;\n&#13;\nAdditionally, cetuximab is also indicated for metastatic colorectal cancer that is BRAF V600E mutation-positive (as determined by an FDA-approved test) in combination with [encorafenib] but only after prior therapy.[L39045]&#13;\n&#13;\nCetuximab is not indicated for the treatment of Ras-mutant colorectal cancer or when the results of the Ras mutation tests are unknown.[L30448]",
        "pharmacodynamics": "Cetuximab is an anticancer agent that works by inhibiting the growth and survival of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing tumour cells with high specificity and higher affinity than epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-Î±), which are natural ligands of EGFR.[L31418] Cetuximab works by inhibiting the growth and survival of EGFR-positive tumours.[A227963] _In vitro_, it promotes antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against certain human tumour types. On the contrary, cetuximab does not exert its anti-tumour effects on human tumour xenografts lacking EGFR expression.[A227963, L30448]&#13;\n&#13;\nCetuximab potentiates the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutics and radiation therapy when used in combination.[L30448] In human tumour xenograft models in mice, cetuximab and irinotecan synergistically inhibited the growth of orthotopic anaplastic thyroid carcinoma xenografts _in vitro_ and _in vivo_. Cetuximab potentiated the _in vitro_ anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of irinotecan and achieved 93% _in vivo_ inhibition of tumour growth when combined with irinotecan, compared to 77% and 79% inhibition when cetuximab and irinotecan were used alone, respectively.[A227978]",
        "mechanism-of-action": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein and a type I receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on both normal and malignant cells. It has been investigated as a therapeutic target for anticancer treatment, as it is often upregulated in cancer types, including head and neck, colon, and rectal cancers.[L30448] When activated by its ligand, EGFR undergoes a conformational change and dimerization to form homodimers or heterodimers with another member of the ErbB family of receptors. Dimerization of EGFR activates the intracellular tyrosine kinase region of EGFR and promotes autophosphorylation, initiating a series of downstream signalling cascades, including cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. This EGFR signalling pathway is often dysregulated in cancer cells, leading to aberrant cell growth and enhanced cell survival.[L31418]&#13;\n&#13;\nCetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the EGFR on both normal and tumour cells to competitively inhibit the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands that are produced by normal and tumour tissue epithelial cells.[A11, L30448] Upon binding to domain III of EGFR - which is the binding site for its growth factor ligands - cetuximab prevents the receptor from adopting an extended conformation and thereby inhibits EGFR activation, as well as phosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases (MAPK, PI3K/Akt, Jak/Stat).[A11, A228078] Inhibition of the EGFR signalling pathway ultimately leads to inhibition of cell cycle progression, cell survival pathways, and tumour cell motility and invasion.[A227963] Cetuximab also induces cell apoptosis and decreases matrix metalloproteinase and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production.[A228078, L30448] _In vitro_, cetuximab was shown to inhibit tumour angiogenesis.[A227978] Binding of cetuximab to EGFR also results in internalization of the antibody-receptor complex, leading to an overall downregulation of EGFR expression.[A227973]&#13;\n&#13;\nK-ras is a small G-protein downstream of EGFR that plays an important role in promoting the EGFR signalling cascade: in some malignant cells, K-ras can acquire activating mutations in exon 2 [L31418] and thus be continuously active regardless of EGFR regulation.[L30448] Since mutant Ras proteins can isolate the pathway from the effect of EGFR, K-Ras mutations can render EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab ineffective in exerting anti-tumour effects.[L30448, L31418] Cetuximab is thus only limited in its use for K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing cancers.[L30448]",
        "toxicity": "The intravenous LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is &gt; 300 mg/kg in mice and &gt; 200 mg/kg in rats.[L31408] There is limited information on the overdose from cetuximab.&#13;\n&#13;\nIn clinical trials, cetuximab was associated with serious and fatal infusion reactions, cardiopulmonary arrest or sudden death, and serious dermatologic toxicities. Pulmonary toxicities, such as interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonitis with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and exacerbation of pre-existing fibrotic lung disease have been reported.[L30448]",
        "metabolism": "Like other monoclonal antibodies, cetuximab is expected to undergo lysosomal degradation by the reticuloendothelial system and protein catabolism by a targetâmediated disposition pathway.[A40006]",
        "absorption": "After administration of a 400 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; initial dose followed by a 250 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; weekly dose, the steady-state levels of cetuximab was reached by the third weekly infusion with mean peak and trough concentrations across studies ranging from 168 Âµg/mL to 235 Âµg/mL and 41 Âµg/mL to 85 Âµg/mL, respectively.[L30448] T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is about 3 hours.[A227963]",
        "half-life": "After administration of a 400 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; initial dose followed by a 250 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; weekly dose, the mean half-life for cetuximab was approximately 112 hours, with a range of 63 to 230 hours.[L30448]",
        "protein-binding": "There is no information available.",
        "route-of-elimination": "There is limited information available.",
        "volume-of-distribution": "The volume of the distribution is about 2-3 L/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and is independent of dose.[L30448]",
        "clearance": "In patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, the estimated clearance rate was 0.103 L/h.[A228003] At doses ranging from 200 to 400 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, complete saturation of systemic clearance was observed. In a population pharmacokinetic study,  female patients had a 25% lower intrinsic cetuximab clearance than male patients, although there was no evidence of the need for dose modification based on sex.[A227963]",

Known ligands include EGF, TGFA/TGF-alpha, amphiregulin, epigen/EPGN, BTC/betacellulin, epiregulin/EREG and HBEGF/heparin-binding EGF. Ligand binding triggers receptor homo- and/or heterodimerization and autophosphorylation on key cytoplasmic residues. The phosphorylated receptor recruits adapter proteins like GRB2 which in turn activates complex downstream signaling cascades. Activates at least 4 major downstream signaling cascades including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, PLCgamma-PKC and STATs modules. May also activate the NF-kappa-B signaling cascade. Also directly phosphorylates other proteins like RGS16, activating its GTPase activity and probably coupling the EGF receptor signaling to the G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Also phosphorylates MUC1 and increases its interaction with SRC and CTNNB1/beta-catenin.Isoform 2 may act as an antagonist of EGF action.",

It is produced in genetically modified Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using recombinant DNA technology. The 260-amino acid sequence of dornase alfa is identical to the endogenous human enzyme. Dornase alfa cleaves extracellular DNA to 5Â´-phosphodinucleotide and 5Â´-phosphooligonucleotide end products without affecting intracellular DNA. In individuals with cystic fibrosis, extracellular DNA, which is an extremely viscous anion, is released by degenerating leukocytes that accumulate during inflammatory responses to infections. Enzymatic breakdown of this extracellular DNA appears to reduce sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity.",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease characterized by the retention of viscous purulent secretions in the airways. These thick secretions contribute both to reduced pulmonary function and to frequent pulmonary infection. Purulent pulmonary secretions of individuals with cystic fibrosis contain very high concentrations of extracellular DNA released by degenerating leukocytes that accumulate in response to these infections. Dornase alfa hydrolyzes the DNA in sputum of CF patients and reduces sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity. The enzyme does not appear to affect sputum in the absence of an inflammatory response to infection, nor does it affect the sputum of healthy individuals.",
        "mechanism-of-action": "Dornase alfa is a biosynthetic form of human DNase I. The enzyme is involved in endonucleolytic cleavage of extracellular DNA to 5Â´-phosphodinucleotide and 5Â´-phosphooligonucleotide end products. It has no effect on intracellular DNA. Optimal activity is dependent on the presence of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium. Extracellular DNA is a viscous anionic polymer and its breakdown appears to improve the viscosity and viscoelasticity of purulent sputum of individuals with CF, thus reducing airflow obstruction. Dornase alfa does not seem to have any effect on non-purulent sputum.",
        "toxicity": "Adverse reactions occur at a frequency of &lt; 1/1000 and are usually mild and transient in nature. Reported adverse effects include chest pain (pleuritic/non-cardiac), fever, dyspepsia, voice alteration (hoarseness), pharyngitis, dyspnea, laryngitis, rhinitis, decreased lung function, rash, urticaria, and conjunctivitis. There is no evidence of carcinogenic or mutagenic properties. The safety of dornase alfa has not been studied in pregnant women, nursing women and children under the age of 5 years old.",
        "metabolism": "While no conclusive studies have yet been published, dornase alfa is expected to be metabolized by proteases in biofluids.",
        "absorption": "Studies in rats and monkeys after inhalation of dornase alfa shows very little systemic absorption (less than 15% for rats and less than 2% for monkeys). The results were also witnessed in patients. Dornase alfa is also associated with very low accumulation with no serum concentration greater than 10ng/mL observed no matter the dose administered. Bioavailability: mean sputum concentrations of dornase alfa can be measured after 15 minutes. Onset is achieved within 3 to 7 days. Peak concentrations are achieved after 9 days.",

Malignant cells expressing one or more of the subunits of the IL-2 receptor are found in certain leukemias and lymphomas including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).

        "indication": "Etanercept is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in adults and in chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in patients 4 years of age and older.[L14862] It is also used to manage signs and symptoms of polyarticular idiopathic arthritis in those aged 2 years and older. Etanercept is also used to manage the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.",
        "pharmacodynamics": "Etanercept binds specifically to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and thereby modulates biological processes that are induced or regulated by TNF.[L14862,A216522] Such processes or molecules affected include the level of adhesion molecules expressed, as well as serum levels of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases.",
        "mechanism-of-action": "There are two distinct receptors for TNF (TNFRs), a 55 kilodalton protein (p55) and a 75 kilodalton protein (p75). The biological activity of TNF is dependent upon binding to either cell surface receptor (p75 or p55).[A216522] Etanercept is a dimeric soluble form of the p75 TNF receptor that can bind to two TNF molecules, thereby effectively removing them from circulation. Notably, etancerpt is only capable of binding to the active trimeric form of TNF as its binding site is located in the cleft between subunits.[A77626]TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses.[A216522] Increased levels of TNF are found in tissues and fluids of those with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and plaque psoriasis.",

It is potent pyrogen causing fever by direct action or by stimulation of interleukin-1 secretion and is implicated in the induction of cachexia, Under certain conditions it can stimulate cell proliferation and induce cell differentiation. Impairs regulatory T-cells (Treg) function in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis via FOXP3 dephosphorylation. Upregulates the expression of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which dephosphorylates the key 'Ser-418' residue of FOXP3, thereby inactivating FOXP3 and rendering Treg cells functionally defective (PubMed:23396208). Key mediator of cell death in the anticancer action of BCG-stimulated neutrophils in combination with DIABLO/SMAC mimetic in the RT4v6 bladder cancer cell line (PubMed:22517918).The TNF intracellular domain (ICD) form induces IL12 production in dendritic cells.",

Bivalirudin is indicated for use in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in patients at moderate to high risk acute coronary syndromes due to unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation in whom a PCI is planned.",
        "pharmacodynamics": "Bivalirudin mediates an inhibitory action on thrombin by directly and specifically binding to both the catalytic site and anion-binding exosite of circulating and clot-bound thrombin. The action of bivalirudin is reversible because thrombin will slowly cleave the thrombin-bivalirudin bond which recovers the active site of thrombin.",
        "mechanism-of-action": "Inhibits the action of thrombin by binding both to its catalytic site and to its anion-binding exosite. Thrombin is a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acting to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and to activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework which stabilizes the thrombus; thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release.",
        "toxicity": "Based on a study by Gleason et al., the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for bivalirudin, administered to rats via intravenous infusion over a 24-hour period, was 2000 mg/kg/24 h.",

        "description": "Leuprolide is a synthetic 9-residue peptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.[A203222] As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.[A203126, A203132]&#13;\n&#13;\nLeuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupronâ¢ by Abbvie Endocrine Inc.[L13850] Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months.[L13781, L13790] Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.",

        "indication": "Leuprolide is indicated for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer [L13781, L34415] and as palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer.[L13790] &#13;\n&#13;\nIt is also used for the treatment of pediatric patients with central precocious puberty (CPP).[L13784, L13787] &#13;\n&#13;\nIn combination with oral [norethisterone] (also known as norethindrone), leuprolide is also indicated for the initial treatment of the symptoms of endometriosis.[L10310] Finally, in combination with iron supplementation, leuprolide is indicated for the preoperative hematological improvement of anemic patients with uterine leiomyomata (uterine fibroids).[L13814]",
        "pharmacodynamics": "Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue that functions as a GnRH receptor superagonist.[A203132, A203222] After an initial spike in GnRH-mediated steroidal production, including testosterone and estradiol, prolonged use results in a significant drop in circulating steroid levels, in line with those produced through other forms of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).[A203126, A203129, A203132] The corresponding hormonal/steroidal changes produce specific adverse effects in different patient populations.&#13;\n&#13;\nIn women undergoing treatment for endometriosis or uterine leiomyomata, careful consideration regarding pregnancy status is advised. The initial increase in estradiol levels may worsen symptoms such as pain and bleeding. Long-term use of leuprolide is associated with loss of bone mineral density. Patients co-administered with [norethisterone] may experience sudden vision loss, proptosis, diplopia, migraine, thrombophlebitis, and pulmonary embolism and may also be at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Patients with a history of depression may experience severe recurrence of depressive symptoms.[L10310, L13814]&#13;\n&#13;\nIn men undergoing palliative treatment for advanced/metastatic prostate cancer, short-term spikes in testosterone levels may cause tumour flare and associated symptoms such as bone pain, hematuria, neuropathy, bladder and/or ureteral obstruction, and spinal cord compression. In addition, patients are at increased risk of developing hyperglycemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, which may manifest through myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac death, or prolonged QT/QTc interval. In addition, Leuprolide may cause convulsions and embryo-fetal toxicity.[L13781, L13790]&#13;\n&#13;\nIn pediatric patients undergoing treatment for central precocious puberty (CPP), the initial steroidal spike may be associated with increased clinical signs of puberty within 2-4 weeks of treatment initiation. In addition, leuprolide may cause convulsions and psychiatric symptoms, including irritability, impatience, aggression, anger, and crying.[L13784, L13787]",
        "mechanism-of-action": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a naturally occurring decapeptide that modulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. GnRH binds to corresponding receptors (GnRHRs) on the anterior pituitary gonadotropes, which in turn release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); these, in turn, affect the downstream synthesis and release of the sex hormones testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estrone, and estradiol.[A203126, A203132]&#13;\n&#13;\nDespite the variety of conditions indicated for treatment with leuprolide, the mechanism of action underlying efficacy is the same in all cases. As a GnRHR agonist, leuprolide binds to and initially activates downstream LH and FSH release; this initial spike in gonadotropin levels is responsible for some of the adverse effects associated with treatment. After 2-4 weeks of treatment, continuous stimulation of GnRHR results in feedback inhibition and significant downregulation of LH, FSH, and their corresponding downstream effects, producing a therapeutic benefit. These effects are reversible upon treatment discontinuation.[A203126, A203129, A203132, A203222, L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814]",
        "toxicity": "Leuprolide is considered extremely safe, with low dose-related toxicity and comparatively mild adverse effects.[A203126] Prostate cancer patients treated with leuprolide at doses as high as 20 mg/day for two years showed no additional adverse effects compared to those receiving 1 mg/day.[L13814]",
        "metabolism": "Radiolabeling studies suggest that leuprolide is primarily metabolized to inactive penta-, tri-, and dipeptide entities, which are likely further metabolized. It is expected that various peptidases encountered throughout systemic circulation are responsible for leuprolide metabolism.[L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814, L34415]",
        "absorption": "Leuprolide is typically administered as a single-dose long-acting formulation employing either microsphere or biodegradable solid depot technologies.[A203126] Regardless of the exact formulation and initial dose strength, the C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is typically achieved by 4-5 hours post-injection and displays large variability in the range of 4.6 - 212 ng/mL. Eventual steady-state kinetics are typically achieved by four weeks, with a narrower range of 0.1 - 2 ng/mL. No studies on the effects of food on absorption have been carried out.[L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814, L34415]",
        "half-life": "Leuprolide has a terminal elimination half-life of approximately three hours.[L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814, L34415]",
        "protein-binding": "Leuprolide displays _in vitro_ binding to human plasma proteins between 43% and 49%.[L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814, L34415]",
        "route-of-elimination": "Following administration of 3.75 mg leuprolide depot suspension to three patients, less than 5% of the initial dose was recovered as unchanged or pentapeptide metabolite in the urine.[L10310, L13781, L13784, L13814]",
        "volume-of-distribution": "Leuprolide has an apparent steady-state volume of distribution of 27 L following intravenous bolus administration to healthy males. The volume of distribution for indicated routes of subcutaneous or intramuscular injection has not been reported.[L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814, L34415]",
        "clearance": "Leuprolide administered as a 1 mg intravenous bolus in healthy males has a mean systemic clearance between 7.6 and 8.3 L/h.[L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814, L34415]",

        "description": "Peginterferon alfa-2a is a form of recombinant interferon used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) resulting in less use of Peginterferon alfa-2a. Peginterferon alfa-2a is derived from the alfa-2a moeity of recombinant human interferon and acts by binding to human type 1 interferon receptors. Activation and dimerization of this receptor induces the body's innate antiviral response by activating the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Use of Peginterferon alfa-2a is associated with a wide range of severe adverse effects including the aggravation and development of endocrine and autoimmune disorders, retinopathies, cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric complications, and increased risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis. The use of Peginterferon alfa-2a has largely declined since newer interferon-free antiviral therapies have been developed.&#13;\n&#13;\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) no longer recommend Peginterferon alfa-2a for the treatment of Hepatitis C [A19593]. Peginterferon alfa-2a was used alongside [DB00811] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 48 weeks of therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].&#13;\n&#13;\nPeginterferon alfa-2a is available as a fixed dose injector (tradename Pegasys) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in 2002 by the FDA, Pegasys is indicated for the treatment of HCV with [DB00811] or other antiviral drugs [FDA Label]. When combined together, Peginterferon alfa-2a and [DB00811] have been shown to achieve a SVR between 36% for genotype 1 and 59% for genotypes 2-6 after 48 weeks of treatment.",

It oxidizes a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Most active in catalyzing 2-hydroxylation. Caffeine is metabolized primarily by cytochrome CYP1A2 in the liver through an initial N3-demethylation. Also acts in the metabolism of aflatoxin B1 and acetaminophen. Participates in the bioactivation of carcinogenic aromatic and heterocyclic amines. Catalizes the N-hydroxylation of heterocyclic amines and the O-deethylation of phenacetin.",

In the absence of fibrin, the alteplase-mediated conversion of plasminogen is limited, thanks to the high affinity between alteplase and fibrin.[A252330,L43125] Alteplase is a purified glycoprotein of 527 amino acids expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.[A252345,L43125] It was first approved by the FDA in 1987 for the management of thromboembolic disease, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI).[A252270] The use of alteplase to manage AMI has decreased thanks to the availability of safer treatments such as angioplasty and stenting. However, its use for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has increased over the years.[A252340] New thrombolytic agents derived from tissue plasminogen activator, such as [desmoteplase], [tenecteplase] and [reteplase], have also been developed.[A252270,A252345] Alteplase is also available as Cathflo Activase (intracatheter instillation) for the restoration of function to central venous access devices.[L34864]",

        "indication": "Alteplase is indicated for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and for use in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for the reduction of mortality and incidence of heart failure. Alteplase is also indicated for the lysis of acute massive pulmonary embolism, defined as acute pulmonary emboli obstructing blood flow to a lobe or multiple lung segments, and acute pulmonary emboli accompanied by unstable hemodynamics.[L43125]",
        "pharmacodynamics": "Alteplase binds to fibrin and plasminogen. Alteplase specificity for fibrin is achieved thanks to its high affinity for lysine residues. Also, it can bind plasminogen via loop structures called kringles, stabilized by three disulphide linkages similar to the ones in plasminogen. The specificity of alteplase for plasminogen bound to fibrin allows this drug to act in a clot- or fibrin-specific manner, leading to low concentrations of circulating plasmin and a lower risk of hemorrhagic transformation.[A252270,A252330] &#13;\n&#13;\nIn patients with acute myocardial infarction, alteplase reduces fibrinogen levels 3 to 6 hours after treatment. In patients with acute ischemic stroke, patients treated with alteplase have a significantly higher resolution of hyperdense artery sign, a marker of clot formation in the proximal middle cerebral artery, compared to those treated with placebo.[A252330] The use of alteplase increases the risk of bleeding and thromboembolic events. Rare cases of cholesterol embolism have also been reported.[L43125]",
        "mechanism-of-action": "Alteplase is a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) that converts plasminogen to plasmin in a fibrin-dependent process. In the absence of fibrin, alteplase converts a limited amount of plasminogen. However, in the presence of fibrin clots, alteplase binds to fibrin and cleaves the arginine-valine bond at positions 560 and 561 of plasminogen, converting it into its active form, plasmin. Plasmin in turn degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus and promotes clot dissolution.[A252270] Alteplase initiates local fibrinolysis with limited systemic proteolysis.[L43125]",
        "toxicity": "Toxicity information regarding alteplase is not readily available. Patients experiencing an overdose are at an increased risk of severe adverse effects such as risk of bleeding and thromboembolic events.[L43125] Symptomatic and supportive measures are recommended. The carcinogenic potential of alteplase or its effect on fertility have not been evaluated. _In vivo_ studies evaluating tumorigenicity and _in vitro_ studies evaluating mutagenicity were negative.[L43125] It has been estimated that the acute oral and dermal toxicity of alteplase is above 5,000 mg/kg.[L43175]",
        "metabolism": "Alteplase is mainly metabolized by the liver. The carbohydrate and polypeptide domains of alteplase interact with hepatic glycoprotein receptors, leading to receptor-mediated endocytosis.[A252270] _In vivo_ studies suggest that alteplase follows zero-order kinetics, meaning that its metabolism is saturable at higher plasma concentrations.[A252270]",
        "absorption": "Healthy volunteers with a baseline endogenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) of 3.3 ng/ml had a 290-fold increase in baseline concentrations after receiving alteplase at an infusion rate of 0.25 mg/kg for 30 min; with an infusion rate of 0.5 mg/kg, a 550-fold increase was observed.[A252270] Acute myocardial infarction patients (n=12) given 10 mg of alteplase in a 2-minute infusion reached a peak plasma concentration of 3310 ng/ml. This was followed by 50 mg of alteplase in 1 h and 30 mg in 1.5 h, resulting in steady-state plasma levels of 2210 ng/ml and 930 ng/ml, respectively.[A252285]",
        "half-life": "Alteplase has an initial half-life of less than 5 minutes in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The dominant initial plasma half-life of the 3-hour and the accelerated regimens for AMI are similar.[L43125]",
        "protein-binding": "Not available.",
        "route-of-elimination": "In healthy volunteers, more than 80% of alteplase is eliminated through urine 18 hours after administration.[A252270]",
        "volume-of-distribution": "The initial volume of distribution approximates plasma volume.[L43125] The average volume of distribution of the central compartment goes from 3.9 to 4.3 L, and the volume of distribution at steady state goes from 7.2 to 12 L.[A252270]",

In ovulation, weakens the walls of the Graafian follicle. It activates the urokinase-type plasminogen activator, collagenases and several complement zymogens, such as C1 and C5. Cleavage of fibronectin and laminin leads to cell detachment and apoptosis. Also cleaves fibrin, thrombospondin and von Willebrand factor. Its role in tissue remodeling and tumor invasion may be modulated by CSPG4. Binds to cells.Angiostatin is an angiogenesis inhibitor that blocks neovascularization and growth of experimental primary and metastatic tumors in vivo.",

Fibrin has a major function in hemostasis as one of the primary components of blood clots. In addition, functions during the early stages of wound repair to stabilize the lesion and guide cell migration during re-epithelialization. Was originally thought to be essential for platelet aggregation, based on in vitro studies using anticoagulated blood. However, subsequent studies have shown that it is not absolutely required for thrombus formation in vivo. Enhances expression of SELP in activated platelets via an ITGB3-dependent pathway. Maternal fibrinogen is essential for successful pregnancy. Fibrin deposition is also associated with infection, where it protects against IFNG-mediated hemorrhage. May also facilitate the immune response via both innate and T-cell mediated pathways.",

Has a major function in hemostasis as one of the primary components of blood clots. In addition, functions during the early stages of wound repair to stabilize the lesion and guide cell migration during re-epithelialization. Was originally thought to be essential for platelet aggregation, based on in vitro studies using anticoagulated blood. However, subsequent studies have shown that it is not absolutely required for thrombus formation in vivo. Enhances expression of SELP in activated platelets via an ITGB3-dependent pathway. Maternal fibrinogen is essential for successful pregnancy. Fibrin deposition is also associated with infection, where it protects against IFNG-mediated hemorrhage. May also facilitate the antibacterial immune response via both innate and T-cell mediated pathways.",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Urokinase is a serine protease that activates plasminogen to an active fibrinolytic protease.[A191928] The duration of action is short due to the short half life.[L12138] Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of bleeding, anaphylaxis, infusion reactions, and cholesterol embolization.[L12138",
        "mechanism-of-action": "Urokinase is a serine protease.[A191928] It cleaves plasminogen to form the active fibrinolytic protease, plasmin.[A191928]",
        "toxicity": "Patients experiencing an overdose may present with bleeding.[L12141] Treat patients with symptomatic and supportive measures which may include application of local pressure, administration of whole blood or plasma, and administration of aminocaproic acid.[L12141]",
        "metabolism": "Because urokinase is a protein, it is expected to be metabolized by proteases to smaller proteins and amino acids.",
        "absorption": "Urokinase is delivered intravenously, so the bioavailability is high.",
        "half-life": "Urokinase has a half life of 12.6Â±6.2 minutes.[L12138]",
        "protein-binding": "Data regarding the protein binding of urokinase in plasma is not readily available.",
        "route-of-elimination": "Urokinase is eliminated in the bile and urine.[L12138]",
        "volume-of-distribution": "The volume of distribution of urokinase is 11.5L.[L12138]",
