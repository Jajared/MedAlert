MedAlert is a mobile app that aims to provide a user-friendly solution for individuals to manage their medication schedules efficiently. With a focus on user-accessibility, our app will offer a simple and intuitive interface, allowing users to set up personalised reminders for their medication needs. Our goal is to help people, especially those with chronic illnesses - to make consuming medication a less tedious and confusing process, which we understand can be very complicated.
